# KUUA
Pop Art Gallery

A gallery showcasing pieces of art for sale. The gallery collaborates with VUMc in Amsterdam, a hospital devoted to advance research in chronic diseases.
KUUA donates 50% of their profits and aims to become a patron of the hospital.
 
## UX
 
The website shows when opening the logo and a painting displayed in an interior, giving a hint of what the visitor can expect to see and potentially acquire on the site.

*The feature of smooth scrolling does not work in all browsers and the possibility of fixing this with a Java Script is out of scope of this MS1*

The flow goes below to a gallery statement explaining who they are and what is their mission, to engage visitors in a program that not only sells art but also helps.

Then, the gallery section appears with a selection of paintings and drawings, with name and prices with two buttons to either open the full size image in a new tab or to express interest on a message to the gallery.

Sections are separated by images of paintings displayed on walls with Parallax effect, giving a smooth navigation feeling

The Contact Us section is a form with Required fields and drop down menu to select style of painting desired.

## User Stories
* As user, I want to see good images of paintings
* As user, I want to be able to look at the picture in detail
* As user, I want to know the price of the piece in advance
* As user, I want to be able to contact the gallery to ask for a particular style
* As user, I want to be able to call the gallery, so contact details are important

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- A Gallery locator/Google map
- A filter of paintins per style

## Technologies Used

The project uses HTML and CSS as laguages with bootstrap 


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
